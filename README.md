This are the code which are part of my grind to learn the grueling art of competitive programming and reach top 100 on [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/users/ong-weng-qi1) for [a certain module](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~stevenha/cs3233.html). :skull:

### Disclaimer

All code **do not follow best practices** for their respective languages as the priority was speed. I will probably clean them up one day if I have too much time on my hands (Maybe never).

Some of the code might be WA, most likely because I gave up trying to solve that particular question. Hence, plagiarise at your own risk. Or even better, don't plagiarise and learn how to solve them by yourself. :smirk:
